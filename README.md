Source files for Signal Void

This is a piece of software built to visually encrypt pixel images. The source file gets transformed to [GCODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) which can be used by a drawing machine - e.g. the [tbd-bot](https://github.com/ntrcpt/tbd-bot). Reverse engineering of the code would (at least in theory) allow you to decrypt the drawings.
